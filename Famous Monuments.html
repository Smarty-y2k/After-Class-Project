    <h1>Monuments</h1>
    <p>A monument is a type of structure that was explicitly created to commemorate a person or event, or which has become
    relevant to a social group as a part of their remembrance of historic times or cultural heritage, due to its artistic,
    historical, political, technical or architectural importance.[1] Examples of monuments include statues, (war) memorials,
    historical buildings, archaeological sites, and cultural assets. If there is a public interest in its preservation, a
    monument can for example be listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[2] The Palgrave Encyclopedia of Cultural Heritage
    and Conflict gives the next definition of monument</p>

            <th>Monuments result from social practices of construction or conservation of material artifacts through which the ideology
            of their promoters is manifested. The concept of the modern monument emerged with the development of capital and the
            nation-state in the fifteenth century when the ruling classes began to build and conserve what were termed monuments.
            These practices proliferated significantly in the nineteenth century, creating the ideological frameworks for their
            conservation as a universal humanist duty. The twentieth century has marked a movement toward some monuments being
            conceived as cultural heritage in the form of remains to be preserved, and concerning commemorative monuments, there has
            been a shift toward the abstract counter monument. In both cases, their conflictive nature is explicit in the need for
            their conservation, given that a fundamental component of state action following the construction or declaration of
            monuments is litigating vandalism and iconoclasm. However, not all monuments represent the interests of nation-states
            and the ruling classes; their forms are also employed beyond Western borders and by social movements as part of
            subversive practices which use monuments as a means of expression, where forms previously exclusive to European elites
            are used by new social groups or for generating anti-monumental artifacts that directly challenge the state and the
            ruling classes. In conflicts, therefore, it is not so much the monument which is relevant but rather what happens to the
            communities that participate in its construction or destruction and their instigation of forms of social interaction</th>

                <th>Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the project for another five
                years. The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th
                anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in
                1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion (US$77.8
                million).

        <th>The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːl qiːlaː]) is a historic Mughal fort in Delhi, India, that served
        as the primary residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned the construction of the Red Fort on 12
        May 1639, following his decision to relocate the Mughal capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally adorned in red and white,
        the fort's design is attributed to Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the architect behind the Taj Mahal. The Red Fort represents the
        pinnacle of Mughal architecture during Shah Jahan's reign, blending Persian palace influences with indigenous Indian
        architectural traditions.</th>
