    <h1>INDIA'S DELICIOUS CUISINES</h1>
    <P>Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the
    diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally
    available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.</P>

        <tr>
            <th>Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices and
            traditions.[1][2] Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in
            introducing certain foods to India. The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and
            fruits. A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava have become staples in many regions
            of India</th>
