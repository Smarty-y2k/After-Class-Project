    </h1>
    <p1 style="color: aliceblue;">Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices and
    traditions. Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in
    introducing certain foods to India. The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and
    fruits. A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava have become staples in many regions
    of India[3]</p1>

                Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe was the
                primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery. Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia.
                Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Europe (Britain in particular), the
                Middle East, Southern African, East Africa, Southeast Asia, North America, Mauritius, Fiji, Oceania, and the Caribbean.
