    <h1>Honeybees</h1>
    <p>A honey bee (also spelled honeybee) is a eusocial flying insect within the genus Apis of the bee clade, all native to
    mainland Afro-Eurasia.[1][2] After bees spread naturally throughout Africa and Eurasia, humans became responsible for
    the current cosmopolitan distribution of honey bees, introducing multiple subspecies into South America (early 16th
    century), North America (early 17th century), and Australia (early 19th century).</p>

                Honey bees are known for their construction of perennial colonial nests from wax, the large size of their colonies, and
                surplus production and storage of honey, distinguishing their hives as a prized foraging target of many animals,
                including honey badgers, bears and human hunter-gatherers. Only 8 surviving species of honey bees are recognized, with a
                total of 43 subspecies, though historically 7 to 11 species are recognized. Honey bees represent only a small fraction
                of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees
