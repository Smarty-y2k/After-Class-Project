    <h1>PIZZA</h1>

        <tr>
            <th>The term pizza was first recorded in 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on
            the border with Campania.[2] Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating the modern pizza in Naples.[3][4][5][6] In
            2009, Neapolitan pizza[7] was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish. In
            2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.</th>
